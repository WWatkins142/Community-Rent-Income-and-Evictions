## Background
This is the second group project for the GT Data Science Bootcamp!

This is the "ETL" Project. ETL stands for "Extract, Transform, and Load". From the "Extract, transform, load" Wikipedia article (retrieved 12/08/21):

> "In computing, extract, transform, load (ETL) is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s) or in a different context than the source(s)."
source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)

## ETL Project Proposal
* We propose to create a database which contains historical rent and income information. 

* We will use data from zillow via kaggle for historical rent prices and data from the american community survey for historical per capita income. The data will be at the county level. See "Data Sources" for the data sources. 

 * We will create a postgresql database which will contain the data. 

* Next steps:
  * Determine what cleanup steps are necessary. 
  * Clean the data. 
  * Database Design
  * Database population - load the information

* challenges:
